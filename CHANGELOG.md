# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.15-SNAPSHOT]

- `--ignoressl` commandline argument to the fxlauncher.jar will ignore ssl certificate errors. This especially usefull when running in a business environment with for example 
the *blue coat proxy* that uses a man in the middle attack to sniff on https connections.
- `whatsnew` option is available, see README.md how to use it.
- App URI can now be any kind of URI, for example file://
- log statements get logged to TEMPDIR/fxlauncher.log. TEMPDIR is OS specific. The Error dialog will show you where it 
expects to find it. Logfile location can be overwritten with the `--logfile=filename` command line option.
- `--offline` flag added. when used on the command line the files will not be checked or downloaded from the remote.
