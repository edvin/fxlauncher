/**
 * The UIProvider is responsible for creating the loader screen and the updater screen.
 * A default implementation is available in the {@link DefaultUIProvider} class, but you
 * can provide a custom implementation to alter the appearance of the loader UI.
 *
 * Implement this interface and make sure to embed the classes inside the fxlauncher.jar
 * right around the "embed manifest" step. You have to do this manually as there is no function
 * in the plugin to support this yet. Basically you have to do the following two steps:
 *
 * 1. Copy the implementation classes into the fxlauncher.jar
 * 2. Create META-INF/services/fxlauncher.UIProvider inside the fxlauncher.jar. The content must
 * be a string with the fully qualified name of your implementation class.
 *
 * Typical example:
 *
 * <div>
 * # cd into directory with ui sources
 * jar uf fxlauncher.jar -C my/package/MyUIProvider.class
 * # cd into directory with META-INF folder
 * jar uf fxlauncher.jar -C META-INF/services/fxlauncher.UIProvider
 * </div>
